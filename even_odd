Checking if the number is even or odd without using the % operator:
Although this trick is not much better than using % operator but is sometimes efficient (with large numbers). Use & operator:

if (num & 1) 
   cout << "ODD"; 
else
   cout << "EVEN"; 

Example:
num = 5
Binary: “101 & 1” will be 001, so true
num = 4
Binary: “100 & 1” will be 000, so false.
