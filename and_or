Use of “and” Though not a very productive one, this tip helps you to just use conditional operator and instead of typing &.

  // C++ code to demonstrate working of "and" 
  #include<iostream> 
  using namespace std; 
  int main() 
  { 
      int a = 10; 
      if (a < 20 and a > 5) 
        cout << "Yes"; 
      return 0; 
  } 

  Output :

  Yes
