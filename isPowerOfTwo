 Efficient trick to know if a number is a power of 2 sing the normal technique of division the complexity comes out to be O(logN),
 but it can be solved using O(v) where v are the number of digits of number in binary form.

/* Function to check if x is power of 2*/
bool isPowerOfTwo (int x) 
{ 
  // First x in the below expression is  
  // for the case when x is 0
  return x && (!(x&(x-1))); 
}
